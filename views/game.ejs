                            In 2022, while all mankind lived in peace, an unidentified object from the sky came and
                            spread a mystery virus around the world, mutating all living creatures on earth into
                            something blood-thirsty and violent. few humans seem to survive that incident, just to
                            suffer more pain and hopelessness since we don’t know how to kill an enemy.

                            since. Until, a group of viators found a way to fight back the enemy with the substance
                            called ‘‘Aniz’. When Aniz contained with a bullet, it became an ultimate weapon for the
                            enemy we can’t even defeat before.

                            Aniz became the most important currency. Everyone needs it in order to survive. The alien
                            blood or alienware are contains a specific hematopoietic that can proceed to Aniz in the
                            laboratory. However, none of that procedure will happen if we don’t get a key material to be
                            extracted into Aniz, the blood of those cruel alien beasts. And who’s going to get those
                            blood?. Of course it must be someone brave enough, good enough, tough enough and mad enough
                            to go out there and fight an alien which is five times bigger than themself.
